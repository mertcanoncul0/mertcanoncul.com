## Hangman Game

<p>
  The Hangman game project I've been working on recently In this project,
  **Preact**, **React Router DOM**, Using technologies such as **React Lottie
  Files** and **Zustand** I tried to provide an enjoyable and interactive
  experience.
</p>

#### Highlights:

- **üó£Ô∏è Multi-Language Support:** Players can select the game language and choose between Turkish and
  They can switch between English languages.

- **Lottie Animations:** I integrated various Lottie animations to make the game experience more attractive and dynamic.

- **Management with Zustand:** I used Zustand to effectively manage game state and user interactions.

- **üìú Modern Technologies:** I developed the project with modern tools like Preact and React Router DOM and Zustand.
