## Rock Paper Scissors Game

<p>
  I am excited to share my **Rock Paper Scissors** project that I have been
  working on. In this project, I developed a game with user accounts and a
  scoring system.
  <br />
  <br />
  I have decided to label the current version as _beta_. I plan to release the final
  version once I improve the design and add the online mode.
  <br />
  <br />
  The main reason I am sharing this project during its _beta_ phase is that I
  want to further develop it based on the feedback I receive. 🙌
