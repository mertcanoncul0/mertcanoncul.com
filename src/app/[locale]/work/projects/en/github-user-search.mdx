## Github User Search

<p>
  I am happy to share with you the Github user search application I have been
  working on recently! In this project, I developed a github user search
  application using technologies such as **Preact** and **Zustand**.
</p>

#### Highlights:

- **ðŸŽ¨ Skeleton Component**: I designed skeleton components to make loading times smoother.

- **ðŸ”„ Management with Zustand:** I used Zustand to effectively manage user search status and interactions.

- **ðŸ“œ Modern Technologies:** I developed the project with modern tools like Preact, Zustand.
